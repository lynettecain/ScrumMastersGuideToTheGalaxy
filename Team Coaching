One of the first things a Scrum Master needs to recognize is if coaching is appropriate for the given situation. Teaching must occur before coaching; for example, a team won’t get any benefit from being coached to pair until they understand what pairing is, why they would want to do it, and what’s in it for them, personally. 

Before coaching, observe carefully. Gather data to ensure you understand where the team is currently at, so you can meet them a half-step ahead of where they are. For example, suppose a team is struggling with self-organization. You’ve observed this is mostly manifesting during Sprint Planning Meeting in the form of team members not taking the initiative to start breaking down tasks; they sit in silence until prompted to start decomposing the work. The team won’t be able to progress directly from silence to plotting 

Once the foundation for the topic is laid, coaching is possible. It still may not, however, be wise. Check for receptivity by asking if the team is open to being coached right now, both to avoid causing frustration if it’s not a good time and building trust. 

Another key to success is in coaching is patience. Focus on one or two things at a time, and celebrate progress. It's also important to take this approach with yourself in your development as a Scrum Master.
